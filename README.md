# Research Project: Analysis of Quality of Life in Selected Countries

The goal of this project is to apply various techniques for dimensionality reduction and attempt to interpret the obtained results. I hope to identify the most effective methods in the context of my data. I will use a dataset that encompasses various factors influencing the quality of life in selected countries worldwide. The variables used for analysis aim to represent different aspects of life such as wealth, healthcare, education, and environmental protection. The chosen countries are representative of each continent and encompass diverse cultural circles found across the globe. Here is the list of countries: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA. All data is from the year 2022.
